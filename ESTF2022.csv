Every meeting was super organized and efficient with time - sometimes the pace was too fast for me, but I understood he effort to pack in a lot.  The relatively infrequent meetings meant I forgot some of the previous learnings/information, but Andra always made a point to review what we were there for and what our goals were.  That was helpful.  Perhaps having more frequent emails to remind fellows to keep on track with the planning and/or implementation of their project.  Our coach, Sarah Watanabe, was great because she knew the materials and had helpful suggestions that allowed us to organize our unit plan.  Having a partner made this project manageable - I might not have made it through it without her.  I definitely wouldn't have had such a good unit without her.","Two things, just FYI's: 1.  I probably wouldn't have signed up for this without the offer of the stipend.  Hate to be money-motivated, but you should know that is important to keep offering it if you can.  2.  The capstone presentations were good, but presenters were not mindful of the time, and some fellows did not have a chance to present.  Perhaps a moderator in each breakout room to limit each presenter's time?  Thank you so much!"
